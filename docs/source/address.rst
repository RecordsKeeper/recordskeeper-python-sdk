====================
Address Class Usage
====================

Library to work with RecordsKeeper addresses.

You can generate new address, check all addresses, check address validity, check address permissions, check address balance
by using Address class. You just have to pass parameters to invoke the pre-defined functions.

Libraries
---------

Import these python libraries first to get started with the functionality.

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import json
    from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    import yaml
    import sys
    import binascii


Create Connection
-----------------

Entry point for accessing Address class resources.

* URL: Url to connect to the chain ([RPC Host]:[RPC Port])
* Chain-name: chain name

.. code-block:: python
    
    with open("config.yaml", 'r') as ymlfile:
        cfg = yaml.load(ymlfile)

Default value of network is **Test-net**, you can change its value to select mainnet or testnet

.. code-block:: python

    network = cfg['testnet']                    #network variable to store the network that you want to access

    if (network==cfg['testnet']):

        url = cfg['testnet']['url']
        chain = cfg['testnet']['chain']
        
    else:

        url = cfg['mainnet']['url']
        chain = cfg['mainnet']['chain']
    

Node Authentication
-------------------

Import values from config file.

* User name: The rpc user is used to call the APIs.
* Password: The rpc password is used to authenticate the APIs.

Default value of network is **Test-net**, you can change its value to select mainnet or testnet

.. code-block:: python
    
    network = cfg['testnet']                    #network variable to store the network that you want to access

    if (network==cfg['testnet']):

        user = cfg['testnet']['rkuser']
        password = cfg['testnet']['passwd']
        
    else:

        user = cfg['mainnet']['rkuser']
        password = cfg['mainnet']['passwd']


Now we have node authentication credentials.

Address Class
-------------

.. class:: Address

Address class is used to call address related functions like generate new address, list all addresses and no of addresses on the node's wallet, check if given address is valid or not, check if given address has mining permission or not and check a particular address balance on the node functions which are used on the RecordsKeeeper Blockchain. 


**1. Generate new address on the node's wallet**

getAddress() function is used to generate a new wallet address.

.. code-block:: python

    getAddress()  

    newAddress = getAddress()          #getAddress() function call   

    print newAddress                  # prints a new address

It will return a new address of the wallet.


**2. Generate a new multisignature address**

You have to pass these two arguments to the getMultisigAddress function call:

* nrequired: to pass the no of signatures that are must to sign a transaction
* key: pass any no of comma-seperated public addresses that are to be used with this multisig address as a single variable 

getMultisigAddress() function is used to generate a new multisignature address.

.. code-block:: python

    getMultisigAddress(nrequired, key)  

    newAddress = getMultisigAddress(nrequired, key)          #getMultisigAddress() function call   

    print newAddress                           # prints a new address

It will return a new multisignature address on RecordsKeeper Blockchain.


**3. Generate a new multisignature address on the node's wallet**

You have to pass these two arguments to the getMultisigWalletAddress function call:

* nrequired: to pass the no of signatures that are must to sign a transaction
* key: pass any no of comma-seperated public addresses that are to be used with this multisig address as a single variable

getMultisigWalletAddress() function is used to generate a new wallet address.

.. code-block:: python

    getMultisigWalletAddress(nrequired, key)  

    newAddress = getMultisigWalletAddress(nrequired, key)    #getMultisigWalletAddress() function call   

    print newAddress                           #prints a new address

It will return a new multisignature address on the wallet.


**4. List all addresses and no of addresses on the node's wallet**

retrieveAddresses() function is used to list all addresses and no of addresses on the node's wallet.

.. code-block:: python

    retrieveAddresses()  
    allAddresses, address_count = retrieveAddresses()       #retrieveAddresses() function call
  
    print allAddresses       # prints all the addresses of the wallet
    print address_count      # prints the address count

It will return all the addresses and the count of the addresses on the wallet.


**5. Check validity of the address**

You have to pass address as argument to the checkifValid function call:

* Address: to check the validity

checkifValid() function is used to check validity of a particular address. 

.. code-block:: python

    checkifValid()  
    addressC = checkifValid(address)                #checkifValid() function call 
  
    print addressC      # prints validity

It will return if an address is valid or not.


**6. Check if given address has mining permission or not**

You have to pass address as argument to the checkifMineAllowed function call:

* Address: to check the permission status

checkifMineAllowed() function is used to sign raw transaction by passing transaction hex of the raw transaction and the private key to sign the raw transaction. 

.. code-block:: python

    checkifMineAllowed(address) 
    permissionCheck = checkifMineAllowed(address)   #checkifMineAllowed() function call
    
    print permissionCheck      # prints permission status of the given address

It will return if mining permission is allowed or not.


**7. Check address balance on a particular node**

You have to pass address as argument to the checkifMineAllowed function call:

* Address: to check the balance

checkBalance() function is used to check the balance of the address. 

.. code-block:: python

    checkBalance(address)
    address_balance = checkBalance(address)     #checkBalance() function call
  
    print address_balance    # prints balance of the address

It will return the balance of the address on RecordsKeeper Blockchain.


**8. Import a non-wallet address on RecordsKeeeper Blockchain**

You have to pass address as argument to the importAddress function call:

* Address: non-wallet address to import on a particular node

importAddress() function is used to check the balance of the address. 

.. code-block:: python

    importAddress(public_address)
    response = importAddress(public_address)     #importAddress() function call
  
    print response    # prints response

It will return the response of the importAddress() function call.
