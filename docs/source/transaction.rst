=======================
Transaction Class Usage
=======================

Library to work with RecordsKeeper transactions.

You can send transaction, create raw transaction, sign raw transaction, send raw transaction, send signed transaction,
retrieve transaction information and calculate transaction's fees by using transaction class. You just have to pass
parameters to invoke the pre-defined functions.

Libraries
---------

Import these python libraries first to get started with the functionality.

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import json
    from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    import yaml
    import sys
    import binascii


Create Connection
-----------------

Entry point for accessing Transaction class resources.

* URL: Url to connect to the chain ([RPC Host]:[RPC Port])
* Chain-name: chain name

.. code-block:: python
    
    with open("config.yaml", 'r') as ymlfile:
        cfg = yaml.load(ymlfile)

Default value of network is **test-net**, you can change its value to select mainnet or testnet

.. code-block:: python

    network = cfg['testnet']                    #network variable to store the network that you want to access

    if (network==cfg['testnet']):

        url = cfg['testnet']['url']
        chain = cfg['testnet']['chain']
        
    else:

        url = cfg['mainnet']['url']
        chain = cfg['mainnet']['chain']
    

Node Authentication
-------------------

Import values from config file.

* User name: The rpc user is used to call the APIs.
* Password: The rpc password is used to authenticate the APIs.

Default value of network is **test-net**, you can change its value to select mainnet or testnet

.. code-block:: python
    
    network = cfg['testnet']                    #network variable to store the network that you want to access

    if (network==cfg['testnet']):

        user = cfg['testnet']['rkuser']
        password = cfg['testnet']['passwd']
        
    else:

        user = cfg['mainnet']['rkuser']
        password = cfg['mainnet']['passwd']


Now we have node authentication credentials.

Transaction Class
-----------------

.. class:: Transaction

Transaction class is used to call transaction related functions like create raw transaction, sign transaction, send transaction , retrieve transaction and verify transaction functions which are used to create raw transactions, send transactions, sign transactions, retrieve transactions and verify transactions on the RecordsKeeeper Blockchain. 


**1. Send Transaction without signing with private key**

You have to pass these three arguments to the sendTransaction function call:

* Transaction's sender address
* Transaction's reciever address
* Amount to be sent in transaction

sendTransaction() function is used to send transaction by passing reciever's address, sender's address and amount.

.. code-block:: python

    sendTransaction(sender_address, reciever_address, amount)  

    txid = sendTransaction(sender_address, reciever_address, amount)   

    print txid                  # prints transaction id of the sent transaction

It will return the transaction id of the raw transaction.


**2. Send Transaction by signing with private key**

You have to pass these four arguments to the sendSignedTransaction function call:

* Transaction's sender address
* Transaction's reciever address
* Amount to be sent in transaction
* Private key of the sender's address

sendSignedTransaction() function is used to send transaction by passing reciever's address, sender's address, private key of sender and amount. In this function private key is required to sign transaction.

.. code-block:: python

    sendSignedTransaction()  
    transaction_id = sendSignedTransaction() 
  
    print transaction_id        # prints transaction id of the signed transaction

It will return transaction id of the signed transaction.


**3. Create raw transaction**

You have to pass these three arguments to the createRawTransaction function call:

* Transaction's sender address
* Transaction's reciever address
* Amount to be sent in transaction

createRawTransaction() function is used to create raw transaction by passing reciever's address, sender's address and amount. 

.. code-block:: python

    createRawTransaction(sender_address, reciever_address, amount)  
    tx_hex = createRawTransaction(sender_address, reciever_address, amount) 
  
    print tx_hex      # prints transaction hex of the raw transaction

It will return transaction hex of the raw transaction.


**4. Sign raw transaction**

You have to pass these three arguments to the signRawTransaction function call:

* Transaction hex of the raw transaction
* Private key to sign raw transaction


signRawTransaction() function is used to sign raw transaction by passing transaction hex of the raw transaction and the private key to sign the raw transaction. 

.. code-block:: python

    signRawTransaction(tx_hex, private_key)  
    signed_hex = signRawTransaction(txHex, private_key) 
  
    print signed_hex      # prints signed transaction hex of the raw transaction

It will return signed transaction hex of the raw transaction.


**5. Send raw transaction**

You have to pass these three arguments to the sendRawTransaction function call:

* Signed transaction hex of the raw transaction 

sendRawTransaction() function is used to send raw transaction by passing signed transaction hex of the raw transaction. 

.. code-block:: python

    sendRawTransaction(signed_txHex)  
    tx_id = sendRawTransaction(signed_txHex) 
  
    print tx_id     # prints transaction id of the raw transaction

It will return transaction id of the raw transaction sent on to the Blockchain.


**6. Retrieve a transaction from the Blockchain**

You have to pass given argument to the retrieveTransaction function call:

* Transaction id of the transaction you want to retrieve

retrieveTransaction() function is used to retrieve transaction's information by passing transaction id to the function.

.. code-block:: python

    retrieveTransaction(tx_id)
    sent_data, sent_amount, reciever_address = retrieveTransaction(tx_id)

    print (sent_data)                   #prints sent data
    print (sent_amount)                 #prints sent amount
    print (reciever_address)            #prints reciever's address  

It will return the sent data, sent amount and reciever's address of the retrieved transaction.


**7. Calculate a particular transaction's fee on RecordsKeeper Blockchain**

You have to pass these two arguments to the getFee function call:

* Transaction id of the transaction you want to calculate fee for
* Sender's address

getFee() function is used to calculate transaction's fee by passing transaction id and sender's address to the function.

.. code-block:: python

    getFee(address, tx_id)
    Fees = getFee(address, tx_id)

    print (Fees)                    #prints fees consumed in the verified transaction
    
It will return the fees consumed in the transaction.
